**General climbing movement suggestions:**

- Moving large distances down is both hard and unfavorable
    - distance difficulty scale factor should be larger for moving down

- Moving up is slightly favorable

- Crossover moves get exponetianly harder over larger distances

- A holds rotation can make a move harder or easier
    - Maybe easier if move direction and hold rotation are similar, harder the more opposite?
